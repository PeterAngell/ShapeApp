# ShapeApp
create a window with buttons to navigate the program, ability to enter values into boxes and then add remove and move shapes created to new cordinates.
possibility to create an executable jar file and use that to run the program instead of using eclipse
you need to add java to path and add a java home path to directory where java is installed and you need java path to go to the bin folder 
after that is done u can run the java file
